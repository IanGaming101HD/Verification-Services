      <li><span>We reserve the right to change these Terms of Service without notice. You are expected to read all terms of
        service before placing every order to ensure you are up to date with any changes or any future changes.</span></li>

        changes.</span></li>
      <li><span>We do not guarantee a delivery time for any services. We offer our best estimation for when the order will be

        taking too long.</span></li>
      <li><span>We are trying hard to deliver exactly what is expected from us by our re-sellers. In this case, we reserve the
        right to change a service type if we believe it necessary to complete an order.</span></li>
